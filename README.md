# Object-Detection-using-Yolov3-FCNN-
Yolov3 is a Fully Convolutional Neural Network which facilitates faster object detection. In this project, pre-trained Yolov3 weights from their official website are fetched, and used for training the Tensorflow model. These pre-trained weights are trained over 80 classes of images, which can detect almost every basic object in real-time.
